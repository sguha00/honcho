Tl: I'm always nervous.I seem to get nervous that th€ tape is sometling that I've got control
of, you know, like its going to be my tape and I think I'm nervous about speaking into
it because usually if it is someone else's then I'm less conscious of it or something you
know.
Cl: Is this yours or is it . . .
T2: Noitsnotmine. ImeanI'mnotgoingto...itsgoingtobetheirs.SohopefullyI'mnot
going to be as nervous as I would have had it been (brief laugh). We could put it where
we couldn't see it.
C2: I don't mind
T3: Yeah, O.K. You don't mind.
C3: Um, I kinda of wanted to start with a part of the dream that I had last night. U m, it's been
grating at me. Every once in a while I have a dream that I fe€l was significant and that .
. . that stick with me and I . . . and I lcrow that I need to know what it meant. This one
part of the dream had a lot of complexities. It re3lly was odd and whal it was was this
car which belongs to a man that I have been dating. I was like looking for it in the dream.
And I couldn't frnd it. And so I thought well he wasn't around. And then all of a sudden
I saw it. It was like in the brush, you know. It was definitely in sight. But it was as if it
was parked so that it wouldn't be in sight. And, you know,I can see the tree limb hanging
down and l'm real intrisued bv it. L . . It definitelv reminds of. . . the fact that this car
doesn'thave head lights right now.
You mean like they are gone. There are holes in there?
No in reality it does but there's something wrong with the headlights.
oh, oh.
Something with the electrical system keeps them working at night
They just don't tum on when you push the butlon.
Yeah.
when you push the button.
Yeah. Which means that he can't drive at night so what he does is that somelimes he
parks his car at the Seven-Eleven and leaves it there and he wouldn't necessarily be there
you know. Let's say he came to visit me. He wouldn't necessarily be there. He left my
place and went someplace else. The Seven-Eleven is like where he leaves his car and
that way it can be watched because they stay open 24 hours.
Well last evening after I left when we were all getdng together, I drove by the
Seven-Eleven to see if his car was there beaause I was interested to know if he was in
town. He is from Cleveland. And I drove by aad the car wasn't there and I remembered
havingathoughtthatmaybehewassomewhereelse.And...ah...ormaybehedidn't
even want me to know lhal he was in town. And I'm pretty sure that's what the dream
has to do with. My concern that he doesn'r want me to know that he's around. Really I
think it goes a little deeper than that. I should say that he doesn't want a relationship like
I do.
Well the thing was hiding. . . the carbeing hidden behind the tree symbolized him hiding
it somewhere.
Yeah. That bothers me (pause) I have different feelings about it.
Yeah, that bothers you that he doesn't want. . . you feel he doesn't . . . .
Well yeah, the relationship . . . O.K. I have to clarify that we have only known each other
for two weeks, O.K. And its probably premature, but we spent a whole lot of lime with
each other in the past week and a half and I was basically on cloud nine about the whole

thing. And wewere talking about going camping togetler whichjust sounded like a geat
idea- And he seemed to really be enjoying me and I was enjoying him and I was kind of
wondering ge€ when is the honeymoon going to end. But . . . feeling like I was ready to
enjoy it as long as it lasted And then he reported to me that he had ulked to his mom
and dad and they had inquired as to whether he had spent the night at my place or not
and he told them that he had slept on the sofa which indeed he did. But then he was
feelhg like he couldn't do that anymore. And I felt hurt a liftle bit at that. And I'm not
sure . . . I'm not sure, . . . I'm a linle angry, where my anger is directed at. I'm a little
confused . . as to whether it's at his parenls or at him. I think both. Um, probably the
thing that that strikes me the most is thal he would allow his parents to make decisions
for him. I feel like . . . if he genuinely inside feels like its wrong to spend the night, ifhe
feels like he doesn't want to do that because he feels like it's not right, then I can really
accept that. I can acrept and respect it either way, but that doesn't get me angry. It makes
me feel a little disappointed or, you know, "shucks I want you to stay wirh me. I wish
you didn't feel that way." But I feel angrier with him I think because it seems to be tlle
sinration where he doesn't de€p down feel that way. It's more like he feels like he has
to do this for his parents. And I don't know . . . I guess um. . . I was involved in a two
year relationship with a man who couldn't make a commitment to me because he was
Ill3rried to Ns mother. And I'm cautious about getting involved in a situation that's
similar....I se€, there's. . . a difference... if he. . . ifhe really um. . .I think some
people can really feel that they want do something for their parents because their parents
request it and on the other hand, "Gee I got to that because its my parens wishes." See,
I don't operate like that. Not that I haven't in the past. But I don't and . . . I don't know
Tl0: I kinda missed that, you don't op€rate like that . . . you don't do things . . . You don't
like to feel is good to do things you really don't want to do just because they kind of
think you should. Is that . . . .
Cl0: Ah-ha.
Tl1: Ijust kind of. . . .
C11: Um-um.
Tl2: Missed the poinl Yeah, OK.
C12: You know, I guess I fe€l I ne€d to cladfy what I mean. Well, there are things like that
my mom wants me to do like write a thank you lener to somebody if tbey send me
something like a card or a gift or whatever I want to write a thank you letter because I
feel like I want to write a thank you lener. And my relationship with my mom has
improved like. I used to get angry with her "Mom don't tell me to do that. I know to do
that" you know. But now I deal with her a little differently. I say either, you know, "I've
already sent it." But then see it kind of ribs me if I say that to her if I say, "Well, I've
a.lready sent it." "Oh Good, you're such . . .
T13: Ah-ha.
C13: A good girl," or something I feel like, Oh gosh. You know, (shon laugh).
T14: (short laugh).
C 14: That the thing I want to do it because I want to do it not because its the right thing to do
from God Almighty or mother or whomever. And . . . I guess that's that's my experience
with Eddie. I want to feel like he's making this decision because he really feels like . . I
mean I don't really care. I don't want to tell him how to behave. I wanttofeel . -.I want
to love somebody who's making this detision on their own. And t don't feel like he's
doing that and that's making me angry.
T15: Um-um.
Tro nsc ri pt of Th e ra py S e s s i o tl
Cl5: I really, you know, I really feel like de€p down he wants to spend more time with me.
But I could be wrong. Um . . . he shared with me that he doesn't know where our
relationship is going, whether or not we would be able to be married some day. And I
had related to him a little earlier that (inaudible) and he kind of implied that he'd like the
relationship to go in that direction and to just take it like where we're not concemed
about whether or not we have a relationship in the fuhrre, but that we just experience
each other in the now. And that's OK with me as lons as in the now we discuss the future
(laughs).
T16: Um-um.
Cl6: Idon't.. Yeah. And I.. Solthink that's probably my . . . This is an area where I'm not
real sure of myself. Um. I question myself. ls it really OK. . to want to discuss a potential
frrture, you know. I'm not ambivalent on tlat.
Tl7: Ah ha.
Cl7: My experiences with it probably should have taught me by now that often times it doesn't
work out real well to discuss the future. Because I . . . it hasn't been real successful. Um
Tl8: Panicularly in that type ofthing. About that. About future relationships with a man and
woman.
Cl8: Yeah.
Tl9: I think panicularly it it gets sticky here. Something strange happens. I mean,l don't mean
it's not a good thing to do but sometimes guys start to get real nervous when that happens.
(slight laugh) I...
Cl9: Mm-mm.
T20: It happens particularly in those things, yeah . . . .You are probably still going to be
thinking about it anyway, The future, whether you say something about it or not?
C20: Well, you know,like. . . It would be possible to not. Ican see possibly having a different
perspective on relationships. The penpective where you do enjoy them now, and if
something happens more than it will. I tend to think about whether I could or I couldn't
live with this person the rest ofmy life. I tend to think about whether or not - . . you know
. . . um . . . Sometimes I'm unsure. I don't have that many suitors (slight laugh) that there
are that many times anyway. So I don't have much experience to go on. Um . . . My past
relationships are are c harac teri zed by basically two long term relationships, one of which
happened very quickly and the other one I was involved in a relationship thal was on its
way to being a long term relationship when I ended that one to get involved with this
otherman.So...(sigh)....I'mnotsure.tlthinkthadarrivedatthedecisionthatl
was not going to bring up the issue of a long term relationship with him, with Eddie.
And then what happened, we met for a couple of d-cafes (laughs) I think that's going to
be the new American expression. ['ll have a cup ofd-cafe (laughs). When we met for a
cup of coffee, hc told me tlat this conv€rsation witb his mom came up and it set off an
alarm inside of me. And I got anxious and concemed. And he's telling me that he's not
going to be able to spend the night at all. It could have gone in many ways. And I guess
what I'm seeing is that I could have said, "Well OK" and continued to maintain the
relationship as much as possible and nol become concerned . . . I don't know what would
have happened. But that's a thing with me. Before he said that, I felt morecenain even
without speaking.
T2l: Certain? What cenain?
C21: About how he felt about me,
T22: Oh.
C22: And, you know, and and . . . .
T23: OK.
81
L-
82 Douglas Bower
C23: No, it was pretty clear to me that he really enjoyed me.
T24: Yah.
C24: He wanted to spend time with me as much as we both could.
T25: Right
C25: At this point I became uncertain.
T26: Doesn't seem like . . . It's kinda like his feelings for his mother are toward her . . . What
do you think? Or did you begin to feel . . . That's how it stsuck me. That was more this
was more sonrething about her than about ihan about you.
C26: Than about me. Yeah, I understood you. I've wondered about that . . . . Yeah! You know,
probably, yeah, it was morc something about her. And I guess the alarm that it set offin
me was "Uh oh," because my last relationship like I said, this man was married to his
mother and we went out for two years togetber and boiled down to he could not leave
home. And, I just like refused to allow that to happen to me again a.nd um . . and, you
know, this guy . . . Here's a situation where mayb€ its not me. Because the last one wasn't
me. But boy he couldn't leave mom. I mean he couldn't do certain things against mom.
And one ofthe big things between Eddie and I is I'm Catholic and he's not. And despite
the fact that he really admires and likes Catholicism and in some ways thinks that
Catholicism is his religion, I met him at a Catholic club, a Catholic group, despite that
his mom has real reservations about that. And um . . . he feels a strong pull to that and
so I wanbd to clarify how he was feeling about me. I did take it as . . . as it was panly
me. And . . . and se€ this is tlp thing. It's so soon in the relationship that perhaps if we
had gone out for a long time together, you know, he would have felt differently. But see
that's what I'm so afmid I'm allowing to happen, we'll go out for a long time and in fact
he won't want to stay with me - .
T27: He won't . . . because of the mother thing again you mean . . . Yeah.
C27: Yezh. Despite how much in love with me he becomes. And so I just feel the need to
clarify that a lot. I mean John really loves me to death. And I know that, but I, you know,
have pain about that because it doesn't matter how much he loves me. He cannot be with
me. He will not be with me. And ah . . . And so ah, you know, here's a situation where
maybe I'm allowing myself to transfer off this relationship. I don't know. I arn not going
to let this past shit interfere. Because, you know, Eddie is not John. And I'm treating it
similarly. And preventing that from happening, which, you know, I can understand but
...Wellso,..mm-mm,
T28: But I was going to say, if the guy didn't feel he could sleep at your house because his
mothersaidthatlldon'tknowwhat..thatdoessoundsomewhat...ah...alonsthat
lineandI...I...
C28: Mm-mm.
T29: I don't know how common that is among people. But . . .
C29: Yez.h, I guess, you know. I'm not concerned with how comrnon it is or isn't. I'm
conc€rned about how I feel and bow he feels. There's some men . . . I mean I don'tjust
ask men to sleep over. I haven't slept with a man in a long time. We didn't have sex. I
mean in a way, it was fairly ludicrous because (slight laugh), you know, what's the
difference, ifhe comes over and we have, you know, we have sex, versus he comes and
sleeps over and we don't have sex, you know. And so I kind ofthink its a little ludicrous
....Um...Heagrees,buttheothertheotherpartofitis...andl...afterlpursued
it, he said to me that . . . ; one thing said was he didn't want to lie. He didn't know whether
to say this or not, but he guessed he would . . . that he had fantasized us married, you
know. But he also said that from the outset that he didn't think it was going to work. Tbe
way he met me. And, you know, that ofcoune didn't feel real good, but you know he
said he saw problems. Which, you know, I see too. (pause)
Trorrsci of Therapy Session 83
ButI wasn't so interested in exploring the problems at that point until this rhing with his
mom srme up.
T30: Yeah.
C30: I was really into enjoying him very much.
T31: Yeah.
C31: And so I got this message from him, "I don't think I'm going to be spending as much
timewithyou."Ifeellikemaybelneedtoclarifythatwithhimand...um...Oneof
the things he said was that he didnt want to see me hurt. And I think pan of what he was
saying, well I'm pretty sure that he was saying, "I want to have a relationship with you.
I really enjoy you. I like you a lot." And I know he does. And I (slight laugh).
T32: Yeah.
C32: But I think that he might be looking at this more in terms of not enjoying me for now,
butthat I'm going to fall in love with him and he's not going to be here for me. (Inaudible)
And, yeah, if that's true I don't want that. And then, but then I, you know, raised the
whole issue with a girl friend who makes a cornment to me that, "Hey, you know, you
enjoy the relationship tlren." And it makes a lot of sense to me (slight laugb). Because
otherwise you could miss out on a lot of relationships if you are always looking, you
know . . . (sigh) But golly. I rea.lly feel like shit. I don't want to waste my time when
down the road, boom. I mean, you know. I've be€n through. I'm aware that the rea.lity
of the situation is he could tell me he loves and wants to marry me someday and then
leave me and for that matter I could do the same to him, you know. I'm aware of that .
. . . It doesn't matter (slight taugh).
T33: Mm-mm.
C33: . . . . . (long pause) A relly fortunate pan of my experience with him is thar he's the
first man that I really really really enjoyed since my last relationship. And I really felt
like I could tell him that I loved him. (Sofdy crying) And I, you know, quesdon whether
I would ever feel like I wanted to ever say that to somebody agaiD. (Softly crying) That's
real nice. And ah . . . I don't feel like I need to contact John anymore. Which I had called
to contact him every once in a while. (long pause). (Blows nose). It it was rqlly good
to feel, you know, like there was somebody out there that I was in love with. (slight
laugh). Ah . . . (slight laugh). (silence with soft crying).
I have really changed as a result of having that experience. I don't know what's going
to happen with this in the future. It's part of me that I'm going ro have to look at. One
ofthe things that happened was I stopped having that need to have it happen. Even now
. . . and I'm not sure because it's not totally over. And if I felt that I wasn't going to see
him again or something, I would get back that feeling. I don't like walking around with
the fe€ling of being available . . . and it's not so much a feeling of being available, it's
more Imking for available partners. I'd rather go on about my business and have
somebody (laughs). I don't really know how to be single real well. From the time I was
sixtoen to twenty, I had a relationship. Then I didn't for a while, but that was almost like
my second latency, you know, where I had a rea.l close girl friend and didn't really care
about men for awhile. We did things like twelve year-olds do. We looked around and all
but never really thought we'd get any of them, you know. But ah . . . then I had a
reladonship for a white with Tom, until then he left for Chicago which was when I met
John and staned to date him. My tetley tea man.
T34: Your what?
C34: My tetley tea man. I don't know why he (inaudible)
T35: Ah.
C35: Imean...
T36: It sounds like a nickname.
L.
u Douglas Bower
C36: He left me a note one time, you know, signed your tetley tea man. I . , .
T37: Ah, OK.
C37: (softcrying)Butah...Solreally...Andlhavebeensayingit'sb€enayearforldon't
know how long (taughs). But it probably will be a year forever. No, it's been a year and
a few months now. And that has really been over and it was several months before that
when it really wasn't working; it's be€n a year or so since I've seen bim. And so I have
been single for a year and three months. Which is amazing (slight laugh). I don't really
know how to be single and be comfonably. I haven't been single cornfonably.
I had a great surruner on the beach but I was always interested in, you know, where's lhe
man I'm going to mee t. I knew that was uffealistic because I was at the beach and getting
ready to move to L-A. but I still had this feeling like maybe I can meet somebody whose
looking for a place ro go (slight laugh). Maybe I'll meot somebody from L.A. I walked
around with that more than I would have liked to. I had some good times. I had some
rea.l good times.
I fc€l like crying. . . .It's almost like I equae aloneness with loneliness (pause). But I
did have some good dmes walking up and down the beacb. And I think that's one of lhe
reasons I'm feeling teary. I kind of see a picture of me walking along the beach. And on
the one hand its really good to be alive. Then on the other it's really rotten because your
supposed to walk down the beach with your lover. (laughs) You know? Like they do in
the commercials. So. That was really strange because for the fint year and three months
of my adult life I didn't have a boyfriend. That was really stralrge cause all kinds of
people ask you, "do you have a boyfriend " Your nieces ask you, "Do you have a
boyfriend?" (slight laugh) No, I don't. Gee lhat's strange. But it's better than having
John, not having one. If they ask do you have a boyfriend, say yeah, but my boyfriend
is married to his mother. (laughs)
(laughs) That's what you say to your nieces (laughs).
(laughs) Really. Well he needs help. He doesn't know how people . . . But anyway it's
alone, alone, alone. It's different. Well, ['m comfortable with myself in that I don't fe€l
like I'djust be with somebody to be with somebody. I need to feel that way. At one point
I worried about that, you know, that I might not do that. But I have had enough chances
now that I tested that that's not true. That's a crisis som€times, loneliness. You know,
which I bave come to realize . . . it's better for me than involvement in behavior lhal I
don't like. .. (silence). .. . (sigh)
One thing Eddie mentioned that I think is wonh considering that hasn't . . a lot of my
time is spent working because I'm in a doctoral program and I do spend a lot of time
working on school and ['m concerned about my future and not even with Eddie, with
anybody. How I can incorporate a full time job with a marriage ard a family. I rea.lly
have some serious worries about what I would do to my kids with so much of my time
into my work. And I'm concemed about that. And what made me think about that was
that he mentioned tbat a lot. And I spent more time sitting down and talking with him
than I have in a long time, with anybody. I take off time here ard there, but we spenr
days together where I do a lot of talking to him and to some extent neglect my work or
save it for times when we w€ren't together and do less than I might have otherwise. I get
less sleep than I might have otherwise. So . I really wondered . . I gorra draw some
lines somewhere. I don't want have kids who have a mother who's never there for them.
(silence)
Uh huh.
Mmm.

T40: The thing was tre facl that you want€d to spend time with him and there was no time to
do both him and the school work made you made you wonder about tho future in that
regard....
Czl0: (silence) Because I feel like I have some conrol over my life and I would like to plan it
in the futire so that I don't get caught in the trap of of not being there for my children.
(silence) Yeah. It really gets down to what's most imponant to me. Cause on one hand
I love to be the scholar and I love to work, and it's really hard ro give it up. But I love
to go and play and go camping and that too. But it's real hard to compromise those two
things.
I think about my childhood and my parents, and I fe€l cheated out ofsome oftheir time.
And I know they worked real hard to make money so that they could give me things.
Sometimes I just feel like it's not wonh it. I mean I feel like it's not worth it (stight
laugh). But (slight laugh) I do. I do. But I feel like those extra couple ofdays work, they,
you know, didn't have to work. They could have taken the day off. lt's tm much. So
now would be the time to starl making a change. (silence).
It's a real difference. Ifs a different kind of pressure you know, I have to make a
conscious kind of effon to put away the books and not feel guilty if I took an evening
ofl I don't fe€l that any more but . . . I surely would feel guilry if t rook a whole day and
night off. But really why I don't feel that way is because I don't.
T41: You don't . . .
C4l: I don't. I don't take that time off. I get my work done so I don't need to feel guilty.
T42: Yeah.
C42: And I am awarc that I am going to get it done. But, you know, in the context of like a
family and all, I might have this much amount of work. I'm not concemed because I am
going to get it done, but where's tlnt going to leave me in terms of time with them and
I mean (}lat's an issue I really haven'r touched upon . . . I don't know if I'm ready to deal
with it. If I can make some changes before that time comes or if I have to deal with it
before then. I don't know. Really where I'm at right now is what I'm going to do wirh
Eddie. What I feel inside. What I feel about Eddie. I feel like I resolved a whole lot about
thaL Just the whole issue about whether he is doing this for his mom. And I don't like
that. And ah . . . (silence) which is real pitiful because I lied to myself about that with
John. For a long time . . Is this going to work out? [ don't know. You know, I confused
accepting him as a penon with accepting the situation with his mom. Out of it was my
struggle to be able to accept pmple. So I really wanted to be able to accept him and long
tcrm. However crazy he was. He's a neat guy, I mean, you know. And then it hits me
thatlreallyfeel...Ireallyfeltgoodbecauselfeltlike...here'st}lisguyhe'sthirty-thre€
years old, he's got his shit together, you know. He's getting his masters degree. He's
taught and what all else and . . . I'm really excited and I do love him. I do love him. But
. . . it's like, hey I have a decision here too (slight laugb).
T43: Yeah.
C43: It's notjust him deciding about me.
Tzl4: It's the kind of thing where you are involved in it makes it makes it more than wherher
you accept him in the situation as long as your right . . . then something . . . also.
Czl4: I'm trying to understand . . . what you said . . . I . . . .
T45: I guess. . . what. . . when you said you confused your acceptance ofhim with your. . ,
with the acceptance of the situation which involved you.
C45: Yeah.
T46: I never thoughtabout that before myselfand suddenly it, you know, you accept the person
. . . You know ifyou are involved with them then if they do somehing thal involves you
I mean, then you can still accept them but. . .I don't know. Itjust struck me I can't. . .

I've been trying to change this guy, you know. I mean to a drastic degree and and it's
finally boiling down to yeah, OK. I respect you. I accept you but we can't be together,
And it hun like hell. Yeah. Yeah. And then, you linow, I realized that I kept wanting to
say something like that to Eddie and I was real honest with him, you know. I want to say
such and such, but I'm not going to and I would either keep it to myself and not say it
or say to him, you know, well . . . Mosdy I kept it to myself and didn't say anything.
There were times when I felt like I could have sucked him into it, you know. (slight
laugh) I could have hugged him atjust tho dght moment or something . . . ,
